This is an example repository which shows off the action [Compile Mermaid Markdown](https://github.com/neenjaw/compile-mermaid-markdown-action) ([Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/compile-mermaid-markdown)).

### About Mermaid.js

>Generation of diagrams and flowcharts from text in a similar manner as markdown.
>Ever wanted to simplify documentation and avoid heavy tools like Visio when explaining your code?
>This is why mermaid was born, a simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via javascript. ([website](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/))

### So why use this action?

Mermaid markdown is not natively handled by github markdown parsing (see gitlab). But there is value in graphs to represent non-tabular data! This enables a repo to focus on the markdown content without having to worry about setting up the toolchain to compile mermaid markdown to an image
